# python-challenge
Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge.

Create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

** A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

** A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

** An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.
# PyBank Instructions
Creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values: ** The total number of months included in the dataset

** The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

** The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

** The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

** The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll Instructions
Creating a Python script to analyze vote-counting process. You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values: ** The total number of months included in the dataset

** The total number of votes

** A complete list of candidates who received votes

** The percentage of votes each candidate won with the total number of votes each candidate won

** The winner of the election based on popular vote
